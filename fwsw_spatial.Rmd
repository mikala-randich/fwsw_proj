This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
park = ParkQuant
colsofinterest = c('Utm_E', 'Utm_N', 'Chloride')
colsofinterest 
parka <- subset(park, select = colsofinterest)
head(parka)
library(geoR)
library(gstat)
library(sp)
library(vegan)
library(nlme)
park_xy = data.frame(x = parka$Utm_E, y = parka$Utm_N)
park_xy
xy_dist = dist(park_xy)
xy_dist
max_dist = max(xy_dist) / 2
plot(park_xy)
cl = parka$Chloride
cl_dist = dist(cl)
cl_dist
mant_cl = mantel(xy_dist, cl_dist)
mant_cl
plot(xy_dist, cl_dist)
park_gls = gls(Chloride ~ Utm_N + Utm_E, data = parka)
summary(park_gls)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
plot(Variogram(park_gls, form= ~ Chloride + Utm_N + Utm_E))
x = park_xy$x 
y = park_xy$y
abn_xy = data.frame(cl, park_xy)
abn_xy
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
