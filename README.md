# fwsw_proj
The aim of this project is to determine if Chloride concentrations in the Floridan aquifer underlying Charleston, Berkeley, and Dorchester counties are statistically spatially dependent and can be predicted by location. 

SCDNR conducted a study in 1985 to identify and map the location of the freshwater-saltwater interface in South Carolina's coastal aquifer systems. Chloride concentrations were the primary ion analyzed to determine the location of this interface.  Numerous wells were tested across the tri-county area.  

SCDNR and the College of Charleston are working in conjunction to re-examine the fw-sw interface, to see if the location has changed. New hydrochemical data will be collected for wells spanning the study area. This specific part of the project will be analyzed the past study's data to determine spatial dependence and the relationship between chloride concentration and location, so that when the new data is obtained, comparative analyses can be conducted. 

To recreate these results, import the data file 'ParkQuant' from the project repository. There are different R markdown files corresponding to different approaches to analyze the data, which can be pulled from the repository and re-run by other persons.
